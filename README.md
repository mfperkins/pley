# PLEY App

This is a copy of Yelp! Well, a very limited copy, but a copy nonetheless. Technologies used are:

* Ruby / Rails / Postgres
* Omniauth for FB logins
* Heroku & Amazon S3

You can check it out [here](https://limitless-wildwood-62359.herokuapp.com)

3. Run `bundle` (and `gem install rails` if you don't already have rails)
4. Set up your databases: `rails db:create`
